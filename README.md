## Installation

    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` for successful execution.

### Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && \
source .venv/bin/activate && \
pip install -r requirements.txt && \
python main.py
```

Upon execution, two new files, `suggestions.md` and `README.improved.md`, will be generated, providing feedback and an enhanced version of the README.

Detailed logs for each run are saved in `logs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`, capturing OpenAI prompts, responses, token usage, estimated costs, and timing information. If executed in GitHub Actions, these logs are uploaded as an artifact for future reference.

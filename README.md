## Overview

The project consists of a small set of Python modules:

- **`readme_loader.py`** – loads the text of a README file.
- **`improver.py`** – contains functions that ask OpenAI to generate summaries, suggestions and a rewritten README.
- **`openai_helper.py`** – thin wrapper around the OpenAI SDK with simple on-disk caching (`.cache/`) and friendly error handling.
- **`main.py`** – command line entry point that ties everything together.

Running the tool will read a README, send it to OpenAI and produce two additional files: `suggestions.md` with feedback and `README.improved.md` with a polished version.

## Installation

To install AI README Enhancer, please follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and insert your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The script will not function correctly without this key.

## Usage

Run the CLI in the repository that contains a `README.md` (or use the `readme-improver` command if installed as a package):

```bash
python main.py --readme README.md \
               --suggestions suggestions.md \
               --improved README.improved.md \
               --model gpt-3.5-turbo
```

Use `--help` to see all available options. You can override the default prompts with `--summary-prompt`, `--suggest-prompt` and `--rewrite-prompt`, or switch to a different OpenAI model with `--model`. By default the tool writes `suggestions.md` and `README.improved.md` in the current directory.

### Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && \
source .venv/bin/activate && \
pip install -r requirements.txt && \
python main.py
```

Upon execution, two new files, `suggestions.md` and `README.improved.md`, will be generated, providing feedback and an enhanced version of the README.

Detailed logs for each run are saved in `logs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`, capturing OpenAI prompts, responses, token usage, estimated costs, and timing information. If executed in GitHub Actions, these logs are uploaded as an artifact for future reference.

## Testing

Run the unit tests with **pytest**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

## GitHub Action Setup

To set up the GitHub Action for automated feedback on changes to `README.md` in pull requests, add the following workflow to `.github/workflows/readme-enhancer.yml`:

```yaml
name: "AI README Enhancer CI"
on:
  pull_request:
    paths: ["README.md"]
jobs:
  enhance-readme:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.10"
      - run: pip install "openai>=1.0" python-dotenv markdown2
      - run: echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - run: python main.py
      - name: Replace README with improved version
        run: |
          mv README.improved.md README.md
          rm suggestions.md
      - name: Commit improved README
        run: |
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add README.md
          git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "chore: apply AI-suggested README improvements"
          git push
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: readme-enhancer-logs
          path: logs
      - run: python post_comment.py
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions in the form of issue reports or pull requests to enhance prompts or introduce new features.

## Demo

The `examples/` directory contains a small project illustrating the tool's output. `README_before.md` is the original README and `README_after.md` shows the rewritten version generated by the improver.

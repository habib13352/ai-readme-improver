*Generate polished READMEs with a single command.*

README Improver is a command-line interface (CLI) tool and GitHub Action that leverages OpenAI technology to enhance and optimize `README.md` files. It provides a concise TL;DR summary, actionable bullet-point suggestions, and a polished version of the README document.

## Features

- üìÑ Auto-generates a TL;DR summary and improvement suggestions
- üìù Produces a fully rewritten README with modern Markdown styling
- üß© Works locally or as a GitHub Action

## Installation

Follow these steps to install README Improver:

1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and optionally add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
   Without it, the tool simply copies the original README.

## Usage

Run the CLI tool within the repository containing a `README.md` file using the command:
```bash
python run_improver.py
```

Optional flags:

- `--logo PATH` ‚Äì override the logo path or URL
- `--email ADDRESS` ‚Äì set the contact email
- `--badge "Name,image_url,link"` ‚Äì add a badge (repeatable)
- `--extra-section "Title:Content"` ‚Äì append a custom section (repeatable)

After execution, `suggestions.md` and `README.improved.md` will be generated, providing feedback and an enhanced README version. Detailed logs are stored in `logs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`, including OpenAI prompts, responses, costs, and timing details. In GitHub Actions, logs are uploaded as artifacts for retrieval.

### Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && \
source .venv/bin/activate && \
pip install -r requirements.txt && \
python run_improver.py
```

## GitHub Action Setup

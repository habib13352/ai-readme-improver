# AI README Improver

AI README Improver is a powerful CLI tool and GitHub Action designed to enhance and optimize `README.md` files using OpenAI technology. It offers a succinct TL;DR summary, actionable bullet-point suggestions, and a refined version of the README document.

![demo](https://via.placeholder.com/600x200.png?text=AI+README+Improver+Demo)

## Installation

To install AI README Improver, follow these steps:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Remember to copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and insert your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The script will not run successfully if this key is not provided.

## Usage

Execute the CLI tool within the repository containing a `README.md` file with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Upon running the script, two additional files, `suggestions.md` and `README.improved.md`, will be generated, offering feedback and an enhanced version of the README.

Comprehensive logs for each execution are stored in `logs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`, capturing OpenAI prompts, responses, token usage, estimated costs, and timing details. When run in GitHub Actions, these logs are uploaded as an artifact for later download.

## GitHub Action Setup

To configure the GitHub Action for automated feedback on `README.md` changes in pull requests, add the workflow below to `.github/workflows/readme-improver.yml`:

```yaml
name: "AI README Improver CI"
on:
  pull_request:
    paths: ["README.md"]
jobs:
  improve-readme:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.10"
      - run: pip install "openai>=1.0" python-dotenv markdown2
      - run: echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - run: python main.py
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: readme-improver-logs

# README Improver

## Description

README Improver is a command-line interface (CLI) tool and GitHub Action that leverages OpenAI technology to enhance and optimize `README.md` files. It provides a concise TL;DR summary, actionable bullet-point suggestions, and a polished version of the README document.

![Demo](https://via.placeholder.com/600x200.png?text=README+Improver+Demo)

## Installation

Follow these steps to install README Improver:

1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` for successful execution.

## Usage

Run the CLI tool within the repository containing a `README.md` file using the command:
```bash
python main.py
```

After execution, `suggestions.md` and `README.improved.md` will be generated, providing feedback and an enhanced README version. Detailed logs are stored in `logs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`, including OpenAI prompts, responses, costs, and timing details. In GitHub Actions, logs are uploaded as artifacts for retrieval.

## GitHub Action Setup

Configure the GitHub Action for automated feedback on `README.md` changes in pull requests by adding the following workflow to `.github/workflows/readme-improver.yml`:

```yaml
name: "README Improver CI"
on:
  pull_request:
    paths: ["README.md"]
jobs:
  improve-readme:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
